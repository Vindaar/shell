* shell
[[https://travis-ci.org/Vindaar/shell][https://travis-ci.org/Vindaar/shell.svg?branch=master]]

A mini Nim DSL to execute shell commands more conveniently.

** Usage
With this macro you can simply write
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
shell:
  touch foo
  mv foo bar
  rm bar
#+END_SRC
which is then rewritten to something equivalent to:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
execShell("touch foo")
execShell("mv foo bar")
execShell("rm bar")
#+END_SRC
where =execShell= is a proc around =startProcess= for normal
compilation and =gorgeEx= when using NimScript.

Note: When using =NimScript= the given command is prepended by
#+BEGIN_SRC
&"cd {getCurrentDir()} && "
#+END_SRC
in order to switch the evaluation into the directory of the =shell=
call.
The same is achieved on the compiled backend by the =poEvalCommand=
argument to =startProcess=.

See [[Full expansion of the macro]] below for more details and how to read
the exit code of executed commands.

Most simple things should work as expected. See below for some known
quirks.

** ~one~ and ~pipe~

By default each line in the =shell= macro will be handled by a
different call to =execShell=. If you need several commands, which
depend on the state of the previous, you may do so via the =one=
command like so:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
shell:
  one:
    mkdir foo
    cd foo
    touch bar
    cd ".."
    rm foo/bar
#+END_SRC

Similar to the =one= command, the =pipe= command exists. This concats
the command via the shell pipe =|=:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
shell:
  pipe:
    cat test.txt
    head -3
#+END_SRC
will produce:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
execShell("cat test.txt | head -3")
#+END_SRC

Both of these can even be combined!
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
shell:
  one:
    mkdir foo
    pushd foo
    echo "Hallo\nWorld" > test.txt
    pipe:
      cat test.txt
      grep H
    popd
    rm foo/test.txt
    rmdir foo
#+END_SRC
will work just as expected, echoing =Hallo= in the shell.

** Handling programs that require user input

Some terminal commands will require user input. Starting from version
=v0.5.0=, basic support for a =expect= / =send= feature is
available. It allows for functionality similar to the
[[https://linux.die.net/man/1/expect][=expect(1)= program]].

Let's consider two simple examples. Assuming we have a script that
reads from =stdin= such as:

=tExpect.sh=:
#+begin_src sh
#!/bin/sh

echo "Hello world. Your name?"
read foo
echo "Your name is" $foo
#+end_src

calling this script using the =shell= macro would normally
#+begin_src nim
import shell
shell:
  ./tExpect.sh
#+end_src
cause the nim program to simply stop upon encountering the =read=
line. Using =expect= / =send= we can handle this:

#+begin_src nim
import shell
shell:
  ./tExpect.sh
  expect: "Your name?"
  send: "BaFu"
#+end_src
As you notice the =expect= line only contains the second part of the
last printed line of the shell script. That is because the =expect=
functionality tries to match the shell output line by line using one
of the following:
- the =expect= line matches exactly
- the line starts with the =expect= line
- the line ends with the =expect= line (useful for long outputs that
  end with ="y/N"= like constructs)
(this may become configurable in the future)

Another example would be installing a nimble package and dealing with
the possibility of having to upgrade / overwrite package:
#+begin_src nim
import shell
shell:
  nimble install foo
  expect: "Overwrite? [y/N]"
  send: "y"
#+end_src
which handles such situations programatically.

*Note*: You may have multiple =expect= / =send= constructs in a single
=shell= call. But keep in mind that every =expect= must have a =send=.

** Nim symbol quoting

*NOTE:* In a previous version this was done via accented quotes
=`=. For the old behavior compile with =-d:oldQuote=.

Another important feature to make this library useful is quoting of
Nim symbols.

This is handled via parenthesis =()= (if you need to run something in
a subshell unfortunately that will have to be done with an explicit
string now). Any tree in =()= is subject to quoting. That means if an
identifier within =()= is preceded by a =$=, the symbol is
unquoted. Note however that for the moment only a single variable may
be quoted in each =()=.

The simplest case would be:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
let name = "Vindaar"
shell:
  echo Hello from ($name)
#+END_SRC
which will perform the call:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
execShell(&"echo Hello from {name}!")
#+END_SRC
and after the call to =strformat.&=:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
execShell("echo Hello from Vindaar!")
#+END_SRC

*** Appending to a Nim identifier

Assuming we have a filename identifier and we want to convert some
image from =png= to =jpg= with image magick. The simplest command
should look like:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
convert myimage.png myimage.jpg
#+END_SRC

This can be done in several ways.

**** Using dot expressions and no string literals:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
let fname = "myimage"
shell:
  convert ($fname).png ($fname).jpg
#+END_SRC
Note that this is a special case. Continuing after a =()= quote
without literal strings will only work for dot expressions. For
instance:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
let fname = "myimage"
shell:
  convert ($fname)".png" ($fname)".jpg"
#+END_SRC
will wrongly be converted to:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
convert myimage .png myimage .jpg
#+END_SRC
which is obviously not what one would expect.

**** Using string literals:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
let fname = "myimage"
shell:
  convert ($fname".pdf") ($fname".png")
#+END_SRC
In contrast to the wrong example shown above, this will work as
expected.

This is especially useful for cases without dot expressions after the
quoted nim identifier.

*** Appending a Nim identifier to a string literal

The other example would be appending a Nim identifier to a literal
string. For instance in case we have a filename, which we create at
run time and we wish to hand it to some command which takes an
argument, which is must be given without a space like:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./myBin input --out=output
#+END_SRC

In this case one of the following ways works:

**** using =()= after a string literal:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
let outfile = "myoutput.txt"
shell:
  ./myBin input "--out="($outfile)
#+END_SRC
If the =()= appears after the literal we can correctly generate the
string without a space (in comparison to the case presented above when
a string literal follows a =()=).

**** For more predictable behavior, put the string literal also into
   =()=:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
let outfile = "myoutput.txt"
shell:
  ./myBin input ("--out="$outfile)
#+END_SRC

*** General remark on predictability

*NOTE:* previously this section said to handle quoting + concatenation
with strings both in the case of with and without space with =()= for
the most predictable behavior. But that was a bad idea from my side!
If you need spaces, simply put it outside the =()= and use a space!

The =doAssert= below is to be understood in the context of the =shell=
macro. To summarize the above then:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
let outfile = "myoutput.txt"
doAssert ("--out="$outfile) == &"--out={outfile}" # <- without space, ident after
doAssert "--out" ($outfile) == &"--out {outfile}" # <- with space, ident after
let fname = "myimage"
doAssert ($outfile".jpg") == &"{fname}.jpg" # <- without space, ident first
doAssert ($outfile) "image2" == &"{outfile} image2" # <- without space, ident first
#+END_SRC

*NOTE 2:* For the moment however, the =()= usage is restricted to a
single string literal (or something that is convertible to a string
via the =stringify= proc) and a single Nim identifier! This
restriction will maybe be removed in the future.

This syntax also works for more complicated Nim expressions than a
simple identifier:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
const t = (a: "name", b: 5.5)
doAssert ("--out="$(t.a))
doAssert ("--out="$t.a)
#+END_SRC
both work. Of course =t= needn't be a tuple. It can also be an object
or even a function call, like for instance extracting a filename
within a call:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
import os, shell
let path = "/some/user/path/toAFile.txt"
shell:
  ./myBin ("--inputFile="$(path.extractFilename))
#+END_SRC
should produce:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./myBin --inputFile=toAFile.txt
#+END_SRC

** Accented quotes

*NOTE*: In a previous version accented quotes were also used to quote
Nim identifiers. That use case is now handled via parentheses. For the
old behavior compile with =-d:oldQuote=.

Accented quotes allow you to hand raw strings.

Note: this has the downside of disallowing =`= as a token to be handed
to the shell. If you want to use the shell's =`=, you need to put the
appropriate command into quotation marks.

*** Raw strings
If you want to hand a literal string to the shell, you may do so by
putting it into accented quotes:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
echo `hello`
#+END_SRC
will be rewritten to
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
execShell("echo \"hello\"")
#+END_SRC

For a string consisting of multiple commands / words, put quotation
marks around it:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo `"Hello from Nim!"`
#+END_SRC
which will then also be rewritten to:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
execShell("echo \"Hello from Nim!\"")
#+END_SRC


** Assignment of results to Nim variables

Also useful is assignment of the result of a shell call to a Nim
string. This can be done with the =shellAssign= macro. It is a little
special compared to the =shell= and =shellEcho= macros. It only
supports a single statement (*), which needs to be an assignment of a
shell call of the syntax presented above to a Nim variable, such as:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
var name = ""
shellAssign:
  name = echo Araq
assert name == "Araq"
#+END_SRC
Here the left =name= is the Nim variable (note: this is an exception
of the Nim symbol quoting mentioned above!), whereas the right hand
side is an arbitrary shell call, in this case a simple call to
=echo=. The Nim variable will be assigned the result of the shell
call, by being rewritten to:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
var name = ""
name = asgnShell("echo Araq")
assert name == "Araq"
#+END_SRC
=asgnShell= is internally called by =execShell= mentioned
above. =asgnShell= itself performs the calls to =execCmdEx= (or =exec=
for NimScript).

(*): a single statement is not entirely precise, because the =one= and
=pipe= operators can be used in combination with the assignment! For
example the following is also possible:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
var res = ""
shellAssign:
  res = pipe:
    seq 0 1 10
    tail -3
assert res == "8\n9\n10"
#+END_SRC


** NimScript & Nim compile time (~nimvm~)

This macro can also be used in NimScript as well as at regular Nim
compile time (i.e. in ~nimvm~ contexts). It uses ~gorgeEx~ in this
case. Some features may not work perfectly. Instead of using the
current working directory, it always starts at the path of the current
project being compiled! So you may need to prepend your own ~cd <foo>~
depending on where you need to run your commands.

** Known issues

Certain things unfortunately *have* to go into quotation marks. As
seen in the =one= example above, the simple =..= is not allowed.

Variable assignments in the shell need to be handed via a string
literal:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
shell:
  one:
    "a=`echo hello`"
    echo $a
#+END_SRC

Also if you need assignment via `:`, you need to also put it into quotation
marks, as the Nim tree is not unambiguous enough to properly parse the
resulting command. Say you wish to compile a Nim program, you might want to do:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
shell:
  nim c "--out:noTest" test.nim
#+END_SRC

A slightly different case is assignment via `=`. A single `=`
assignment in a command is possible, but not more. That is due to a
Nim parser limitation (as you cannot have "nested" `nnkAsgn` nodes).

So this:
#+begin_src sh
shel:
  foo --bar --option=value --more
#+end_src
is fine, but this:
#+begin_src sh
shell:
  foo --bar --option=value --secondOption=value2
#+end_src
is *not* valid Nim syntax. Fortunately, in most cases the `=` sign is
optional anyway and you may just drop (one or both):
#+begin_src sh
shel:
  foo --bar --option value --secondOption value2
#+end_src
is valid and means the same for most programs.

In general, if in doubt you can just write strings or triple string
(to pass a ="= to the shell).

** Full expansion of the macro

As mentioned at the top of the README, the expansion shown is
simplified (as a matter of fact it was as simple once, but has since
become more complex).

The full expansion of the first example is:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
discard block:
  var outputStr381052 = ""
  var exitCode381051: int
  if exitCode381051 ==
      0:
    let tmp381063 = execShell("touch foo")
    outputStr381052 = outputStr381052 &
        tmp381063[0]
    exitCode381051 = tmp381063[1]
  else:
    echo "Skipped command `" & "touch foo" &
        "` due to failure in previous command!"
  if exitCode381051 ==
      0:
    let tmp381064 = execShell("mv foo bar")
    outputStr381052 = outputStr381052 &
        tmp381064[0]
    exitCode381051 = tmp381064[1]
  else:
    echo "Skipped command `" & "mv foo bar" &
        "` due to failure in previous command!"
  if exitCode381051 ==
      0:
    let tmp381065 = execShell("rm bar")
    outputStr381052 = outputStr381052 &
        tmp381065[0]
    exitCode381051 = tmp381065[1]
  else:
    echo "Skipped command `" & "rm bar" &
        "` due to failure in previous command!"
  (outputStr381052, exitCode381051)
#+END_SRC

As can be seen from the expansion above, successive commands are only
run, if the exit code of the previous command was 0, while the output
is appended to the previous command's output.

The normal =shell= command discards the return value of the block. If
you want to keep it, use the =shellVerbose= macro:
#+BEGIN_SRC nim
let res = shellVerbose:
  someCommand
#+END_SRC
where =res= will be of type =tuple[output: string, exitCode: string]=
according to the expansion above.

** Debugging
In order to see what's going on, you can either compile your program
with the =-d:debugShell= flag, which will then echo the rewritten
commands during compilation.
Alternatively in order to avoid calling the commands immediately, you
may use the =shellEcho= macro instead. It simply echoes the commands
that would otherwise be run.

** Error reporting

By default ~shell~ prints output messages to stdout:

#+BEGIN_SRC nim :exports both :results scalar
import shell

shell:
  ls
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: shellCmd: ls
: shell> nim.cfg
: shell> README.org
: shell> shell
: shell> shell.nim
: shell> shell.nim.bin
: shell> shell.nimble
: shell> tests

What is printed to stdout can be configured by using defines:

- ~shellNoDebugOutput~ :: Do not print command output
- ~shellNoDebugError~ :: Do not print error output
- ~shellNoDebugCommand~ :: Do not print command being executed
- ~shellNoDebugRuntime~ :: When error occurs do not print failed command

By default these are disabled - to enable use either
~-d:shellNoDebug*~ or use the ~{.define(shellNoDebug*).}~ pragma

#+BEGIN_SRC nim :exports both :results scalar
{.define(shellNoDebugOutput).}

import shell

shell:
  ls
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: shellCmd: ls

The default ~shellVerbose~ command combines stderr and stdout into
single result. To get =stdout=, =stderr= and the return code
separately use ~shellVerboseErr~. Both of these templates have an
overload that takes ~set[DebugOutputKind]~ to control printing
settings:

#+BEGIN_SRC nim :exports both :results scalar
import shell

let (res, err, code) = shellVerboseErr {dokCommand}:
  echo "test"

echo "Returned string: '", res, "' with exit code ", code

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: shellCmd: echo test
: Returned string: 'test' with exit code 0

Printing errors directly into stdout is good solution for most of the
use cases, but sometimes it is necessary to provide more sophisticated
error handing - throwing an exception when the command failed. To
switch to exceptions use ~-d:shellThrowException~. It will
automatically disable all other output types in the default
configuration.

#+begin_src nim :exports both :results scalar
{.define(shellThrowException).}

import shell, strutils

try:
  shell:
    ls -l
    ls -z
except ShellExecError:
  let e = cast[ShellExecError](getCurrentException())
  echo e.msg # Error message describing what happened
  echo "command was: ", e.cmd # Original command string
  assert e.cmd == "ls -z"
  echo "return code: ", e.retcode # Return code
  echo "regular out: ", e.outstr # Stdout from command
  echo "error outpt: "
  for l in e.errstr.split('\n'): # Stderr from the command
    echo "  ", l
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Command ls -z exited with non-zero code
: command was: ls -z
: return code: 2
: regular out:
: error outpt:
:   ls: invalid option -- 'z'
:   Try 'ls --help' for more information.

On command failure ~ShellExecError~ is raised.

Note that some commands output error messages into ~stdout~ rather
than into ~stderr~ - it might be necessary to check both. In this
particular example content of the ~stderr~ is largely meaningless:
actual reason for error was printed into ~stdout~.

#+begin_src nim :exports both :results scalar
{.define(shellThrowException).}

import shell, strutils

try:
  shell:
    ngspice -b "/tmp/ngpsice-simulation/zzz.netkRs8jE"
except ShellExecError:
  let e = cast[ShellExecError](getCurrentException())
  echo e.msg # Error message describing what happened
  echo "command was: ", e.cmd # Original command string
  echo "exec direct: ", e.cwd # 
  echo "return code: ", e.retcode # Return code
  echo "regular out: \n====\n", e.outstr # Stdout from command
  echo "====\nerror outpt: \n====\n", e.errstr # Stderr from the command
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
