* v0.6.0
- print process ID for the spawned process by default. Can be disabled
  by compiling with ~-d:PrintPid=false~.
* v0.5.2
- add preliminary support for ~shell~ in macros (i.e. in ~nimvm~ contexts)
* v0.5.1
- ~send~ can now be used without an explicit ~expect~
* v0.5.0
- add =expect= / =send= construct to DSL
* v0.4.4
- allow (single) `nnkAsgn` in macro, e.g. to write
  =foo --option=value --more=. Note that only a single assignment is valid.
* v0.4.3
- replace travis CI by Github Actions (now includes Windows and OSX
  testing)
  - windows support is only partial. =one= and =pipe= appear to be
    broken
- change =shellVerboseImpl=, =shellVerbose= internals
- allow to customize the process options, which are handed to
  =startProcess=
- command not found on windows is an =OSError=, which we catch and
  turn into an error code
- do not close error stream manually anymore (should not be done
  according to Nim docs of =osproc.errorStream=)

* v0.4.2
- fix =shellAssign= to allow quoting of Nim variables
* v0.4.1
- improve handling of complicated quoting expressions
